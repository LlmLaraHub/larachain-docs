Your First Collection
===================================

Assuming the setup is working you should be able to login in and see a screen like the following:

Sorry the button will most likely say something else but you get the gist ðŸ™ƒ


Add Name and Description
----------------

.. image:: images/create.png
    :alt: Create Collection


Choose the LLM
----------------

Now give it a name and a description. The description will help in prompting.

And you can choose your LLM.

    :alt: Choose LLM


The Collection Screen
----------------

.. image:: images/collection_screen.png
    :alt: The Collection Screen

1. The url
2. Just a note of what LLM you have setup for this Collection
3. The embedding model
4. This is where you can edit and change the Model (keep in mind the embedding can not change else you have to run it again)
5. Add a file see ``tests/example-docs``
6. You can see the documents below and the checkboxes to do Actions.
7. The optoins menu to Chat or add Outputs etc.


.. note::

    Then upload a file, just one small one to start, there are examples ones here:
    ``tests/example-docs``
